# ComputerCraftMod
This is a remake of the Minecraft mod Computercraft that an be found here. With this remake, you can program computers and robots with Lua in Minecraft (Java &amp; Bedrock) and Lua is very simple to learn. If you've questions, improvement ideas or I you want to report bugs in this mod, feel free to ask that in the forum here: https://computercraft.xobor.de.
!!! VERY IMPORTANT NOTES !!! :
* This remake does currently not support Minecraft 1.18/1.18.1 and MCPE 1.18.2 because the application Mcreator, in which I've developed the mod, has not yet 1.18 support.
* There's also a mobile version from this mod for non-java players as an MCPE add-on, but the MCPE add-on lacks currently with many features.
* The mod ONLY supports the following Minecraft/MCPE versions:
* MCPE 1.14 until MCPE 1.17.41.01
* Minecraft: Java Edition 1.12.2 until Minecraft: Java Edition 1.17.1
